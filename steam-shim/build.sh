# Build the steam.exe shim from the tracked sources in this directory.
#
# The shim is a PE executable and the wine build tree's own make builds it, so
# unlike the lsteamclient unix half there is no hand-rolled compile or link here.
#
# Only x86_64 is built and shipped. The tree can produce an i386 shim as well and
# nothing consumes it: RUN_SCRIPT stages one flat steam.exe into the prefix Steam
# directory, and a 32 bit game reaching it gets a separate process under wow64, so
# the 64 bit build serves both.
#
# A rebuild from unchanged source is byte-identical except for TimeDateStamp and
# the optional header CheckSum, so the hash reported below has those two fields
# zeroed and is comparable across builds. See pe-info.py.
#
# Usage:
#   ./build.sh              build and verify
#   ./build.sh --install    also install to the bridge
#
# Overridable: WINE_BUILD, WINE_SRC_REL, BRIDGE_DIR
